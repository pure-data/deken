Best Practice Packaging
=======================

## Sourceful uploads

`deken` is very much about *sharing*.
To make sharing a more lasting experience, `deken` encourages the upload of
"source-packages" besides (pre-compiled) binary packages.

This is especially important if you are uploading a library that has been
released under a license that requires you to share sources along with binaries
(e.g. software licensed under the Gnu GPL), where it is your obligation to
provide the source code to the end users.
In other situations, having Source packages might be less important (e.g. it is
fine to use `deken` with closed source libraries), however we would like to
encourage sharing of sources.

The way `deken` implements all this is by using a special pseudo architecture
"Sources", which contains the sources of a library.

`deken package` tries to automatically detect whether a package contains Sources
by looking for common source code files (*.c, *.cpp, ...).

When uploading a package, `deken` will ensure that you are *also* uploading a
Source package of any library.
If a Source package is missing, `deken` will abort operation.
You can override this (e.g. because you have already uploaded a Source package;
or because you simply do not want to upload any sources) by using the
`--no-source-error` flag.

For uploading a Source package along with binary packages, you can upload one
package file with multiple archs (including a "Sources" arch) or multiple package
files (one for the "Sources" arch).

~~~sh
$ deken upload frobnozzel(Windows-i386-32)(Sources).dek
$ deken upload foobar[v0.1](Linux-x86_64-32).dek foobar[v0.1](Sources).dek
~~~

## Object Lists

Oftentimes users only have a patch with a broken object,
without knowing which library contains this package.

Provide an [object list](objectlist.md) to make the content of your package searchable.
