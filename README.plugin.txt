A minimal package management system for Pure Data externals.
============================================================

Packages are stored on <https://deken.puredata.info/> and can be installed using the
`Help -> Find Packages` menu.

## README.1st ##

Since Pd-0.47, the `deken-plugin` is included into Pure Data itself,
so the only reason to manually install it is to get the newest version.

When manually installing the `deken-plugin`, Pd will use it if (and only if) it
has a greater version number than the one included in Pd.
In this case you will see something like the following in the Pd-console (you
first have to raise the verbosity to `Debug`):

> Loading plugin: /home/zmoelnig/src/puredata/deken/deken-plugin/deken-plugin.tcl
> [deken]: installed version [0.2.1] < 0.2.3...overwriting!
> [deken] deken-plugin.tcl (Pd externals search) loaded from /home/zmoelnig/src/puredata/deken/deken-plugin.

## Trusting packages

The `deken-plugin` will help you find and install Pd-libraries.
However, it does not verify whether a given package is downloaded from a trusted
source or not.

As of now, the default package source is https://deken.puredata.info/.
Anybody who has an account on the https://puredata.info website (currently
that's a few thousand people) can upload packages, that the `deken-plugin` will
happily find and install for you.

In order to make these packages more trustworthy, we ask people to sign their
uploaded packages with the GPG-key.
Unfortunately the deken-plugin does not check these signatures yet.
If you are concerned about the authenticity of a given download, you can check
the GPG-signature manually, by following these steps:

- Navigate to `Help -> Find Packages` and search for an external
- Right-Click one of the search results
- Select "Copy package URL" to copy the link to the downloadable file to your clipboard
- Download the package from the copied link
- Back in the deken search results, select "Copy OpenGPG signature URL"
- Download the GPG-signature from the copied link to the same location as the package
- Run `gpg --verify` on the downloaded file

If the signature is correct, you can decide yourself whether you actually trust
the person who signed:
- Do you trust the signature to be owned by the person?
- Do you know the person?
- Do you trust them enough to let them install arbitrary software on your machine?
